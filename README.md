Construct Week of Unit-2 | Project — Zara
Hello Everyone, My name is Pragati Tiwari. Currently, I’m pursuing a Full Stack Web Development course at Masai School. I’m in unit-2. At the end of unit-2, Masai School gives a project to clone based on the syllabus of unit-2. We have to clone based on whatever we have learned so far till unit-2.

They have assigned me a Project name called Zara.
Project Details :

ZARA is one of the largest international fashion companies. It has more than 2,270 stores. The company specializes in fast fashion, and products include clothing, accessories, shoes, swimwear, beauty, and perfumes.

My task was to clone the homepage (landing page), SignUp, login page, Mens, Womens, add to bag and cart page, checkout page, and payment page.

How I cloned ZARA Website:

First, I built a homepage. On the homepage I have created a logo, In the logo, I have fixed a homepage page link like whenever a customer will click on a logo then he will get redirected to the homepage. After that, I have created a fixed navbar on top and bottom and added some auto-timer depending on the slider image which looks more pretty, and then I have added some pictures related to Zara products which will be available on the Zara website. After that, I have added a footer on the Zara website.

After the homepage, I have created a signup page where the customers can create an account, he or she can log in to the zara website.


After signing, I have created a products page like the men's and women’s pages from where customers can shop from the men's and women's pages as per their choice.


Womens Page

Men's page


After purchasing a product as per their choice, They can add it to the bag(cart) and remove it as well from the bag.


Add to Bag

Remove or Delete


After that, the customer will be redirected to the Payment page i.e checkout page.
Once payment is successful, an order will be placed and items will be delivered to the given address.


I hope this article will help you to understand my project. Thank you for reading.
